Hello, World!!!

My name is Jessica McCallan. I am madly in love with coffee. I enjoy music and art. I have two kid. A boy name Blake who is going to be 4 on the 28th of February and a daughter name Ellen who just turned 3 on the 13th of February. They are my life. I am currently a stay at home mom looking for something that is always gonna be interesting and to give my family the things they deserve in life. Tacos, pizza, and coffee is a food group all on its own. Just don't put them together. It will taste horrible.
